## About

WarMine is a multiplayer mod that allows the organization of teams and territories, providing the moderator with commands to add new teams and players, and giving players resources such as teleportation, leaderboard, territory features, among many others.

WarMine continuously monitors events, restricting player actions to ensure the protection of player territories and featuring its own warfare system for territory attacks!

Experience new blocks, items, and professions for Villagers. WarMine is only in its early stages; for more information, visit our page on CurseForge.

WarMine has high compatibility with other mods, so feel free to use it in any modpack.
